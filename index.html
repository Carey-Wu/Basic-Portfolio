                    <p>I'm originally from South Jersey in the Medford and Cherry Hill area.  I'm the youngest of 3, with an older brother and a twin brother.  In my free time, I play alot of volleyball.  I currently play at an A/AA level in various beach and grass tournaments, as well as indoor volleyball leagues.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I currently work as a Project Manager for an industrial hygiene and safety consulting firm in their technologies division. I mainly deal with remediation and major construction projects in regards to air monitoring and related aspects. We currently use a proprietary system that we designed to monitor these kinds of projects.  I'm hoping to expand my coding knowledge so that I can design the next generation system for us to use.</p>
